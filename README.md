# Bio-data collector 
The project utilizes LangChain and Language Models (LLMs) for data collection from LinkedIn and Twitter profiles based on a person's name. Here's a breakdown of the key points:

Profile Retrieval: LinkedIn and Twitter profiles are obtained using APIs or web scraping methods.

Data Collection: Relevant information such as professional experience, education, skills, tweets, followers, and engagement metrics is gathered.

LangChain Analysis: LangChain is employed for natural language processing (NLP) tasks like sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and entity recognition.

Data Storage: The collected data, along with LangChain analysis results, is stored in a structured format or database.

Visualization and Insights: Visualizations and reports summarize the data, providing insights into the person's professional background and social media activity.
